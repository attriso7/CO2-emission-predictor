# CO2-emission-predictor
    "In this project i have demonstrated my skill in Machne Learning (Linear regression) to predict CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of cars. <br>\n",
    "The model takes scaled input of Engine Size (L), Cylinders, Fuel Consumption (L/100Km), Hwy (L/100 km) and Outputs CO<sub>2</sub>. <br>\n",
    "The model has been tested and evaluated on two set for testing and cross validation and an $R^2$ value of 0.96 is obtained on the Cross validation set."
