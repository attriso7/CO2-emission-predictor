# CO2 Emission Predictor

## Overview

This project focuses on using Linear Regression to predict the CO2 emissions of cars.

In this project, I have demonstrated my skills in Machine Learning, specifically using Linear Regression, to predict CO2 emissions of cars. The model takes the following scaled input features:
- Engine Size (L)
- Cylinders
- Fuel Consumption (L/100Km)
- Hwy (L/100 km)

It then outputs the predicted CO2 emissions.

## Model Evaluation

The model has been tested and evaluated on two different datasets: a testing dataset and a cross-validation dataset. During the cross-validation, the model achieved an impressive R-squared value of 0.96, demonstrating its strong predictive performance.

Feel free to explore this repository to learn more about the project and the code behind it.

## Usage

You can clone this repository to your local machine and run the Jupyter Notebook to see the code in action.
