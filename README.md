# CO2 Emission Predictor

## Overview

This project focuses on using Linear Regression to predict the CO2 emissions of cars.

In this project, I have demonstrated my skills in Machine Learning, specifically using Linear Regression, to predict CO2 emissions of cars. The model takes the following scaled input features:
- Engine Size (L)
- Cylinders
- Fuel Consumption (L/100Km)
- Hwy (L/100 km)

It then outputs the predicted CO2 emissions.

## Libraries Used

- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): A powerful machine learning library.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A versatile data analysis and manipulation library.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): A plotting and visualization library.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): A data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- IO

## Model Evaluation

The model has been tested and evaluated on two different datasets: a testing dataset and a cross-validation dataset. During the cross-validation, the model achieved an impressive R-squared value of 0.96, demonstrating its strong predictive performance.
